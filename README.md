#### Many concepts in discrete mathematics can be written in Java. 

Some examples include:

* Combinatorics: Java can be used to write code that generates permutations and combinations of a given set of elements. 
  ``` Combinatorics: int[] arr = {1,2,3}; combinations(arr);```

* Number theory: Java can be used to write code that performs operations on integers such as finding the greatest common divisor, or calculating modular arithmetic.
  ```Number theory: int gcd = GCD(x,y);```
* Graph theory: Java can be used to write code that represents graphs, performs graph traversals and finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
  ``` Graph theory: Graph graph = new Graph(5); ```
* Combinatorial game theory: Java can be used to write code that plays simple combinatorial games such as Nim, and solves more complex games such as chess and Go.
  ``` Combinatorial game theory: game.play(player1, player2); ```
* Combinatorial optimization: Java can be used to write code that solves problems such as the travelling salesman problem and the knapsack problem.
  ``` Combinatorial optimization: int maxValue = knapsack(val, wt, W); ```
* Boolean algebra: Java can be used to write code that performs operations on Boolean values, such as evaluating logical expressions and converting circuits to canonical forms.
  ``` Boolean algebra: boolean result = evaluateExpression("1+0*1") ```
* Recursion: Java can be used to write code that uses recursion to solve problems, for example, to find the nth Fibonacci number.
  ``` Recursion: int fib = fibonacci(10); ```
* Automata and Formal languages: Java can be used to write code that implements finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines, and to recognize and generate formal languages.
  ``` Automata and Formal languages: NFA nfa = new NFA(2,3); ```
