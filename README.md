#### Many concepts in discrete mathematics can be written in Java. 

Some examples include:

* Combinatorics: Java can be used to write code that generates permutations and combinations of a given set of elements.

* Number theory: Java can be used to write code that performs operations on integers such as finding the greatest common divisor, or calculating modular arithmetic.

* Graph theory: Java can be used to write code that represents graphs, performs graph traversals and finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

* Combinatorial game theory: Java can be used to write code that plays simple combinatorial games such as Nim, and solves more complex games such as chess and Go.

* Combinatorial optimization: Java can be used to write code that solves problems such as the travelling salesman problem and the knapsack problem.

* Boolean algebra: Java can be used to write code that performs operations on Boolean values, such as evaluating logical expressions and converting circuits to canonical forms.

* Recursion: Java can be used to write code that uses recursion to solve problems, for example, to find the nth Fibonacci number.

* Automata and Formal languages: Java can be used to write code that implements finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines, and to recognize and generate formal languages.
